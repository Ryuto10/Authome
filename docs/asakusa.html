        Asakusa has a long long history as a leading “entertainment district”, so you can feel the vibe of traditional Tokyo cultures. In addition, Asakusa is a great place to get original Japanese souvenirs only available there.

    <h1>Sensoji Temple</h1>
    <img src="https://github.com/Ryuto10/Authome/blob/main/docs/images/sensoji.jpeg?raw=true">
    <p>
        Sensoji is one of the most famous temples in Japan. Sensoji has its famous entrance gate called Kaminarimon, which stands out through a large red lantern, and the traditional shopping street called Nakamise Dori. Most visitors come to Asakusa during the daytime, but Sensoji offers a different beauty when lit up after sundown.

    <h1>Tokyo Skytree</h1>
    <img src="https://github.com/Ryuto10/Authome/blob/main/docs/images/Tokyo_Skytree.jpeg?raw=true">
    <p>
        Tokyo Skytree is a television broadcasting tower with a height of 634 meters. It has two observation decks which offer amazing views over Tokyo.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tembo Deck, located at height of 350 meters, spans three floors. The top floor offers the best 360 degree panoramic views of the city. Tembo Galleria, located at height 450 meters, is called “the world’s highest skywalk”. You can look over the entire Kanto Region.
    </p>
    <h1>Sumida River</h1>
    <img src="https://github.com/Ryuto10/Authome/blob/main/docs/images/sumida_river.jpeg?raw=true">
    <p>
        Sumida River has acted as the gateway to the sea (Tokyo Bay) from ancient times. I recommend Tokyo Cruise, a water bus ride along the Sumida River.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is relaxing, romantic, and full of photo opportunities. Tokyo Cruise offers several different lines. The Sumida River Line connects Asakusa to Hinode Pier, the Odaiba Line connects Hinode Pier to Odaiba Kaihin Park, and the Tokyo Big Sight & Palette Town Line runs between Hinode Pier and two of Odaiba’s two popular spots.
